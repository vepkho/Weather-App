# Weather Application

It wass my first ReactJS application, where I tried to use my theoretical knowledge  in practice.

## Experience I gained 

Working with 

- Props
- states
- API 
- Forms
- Build a custom components 

## Lessons I learned

Difference between `file.css` and `file.module.css` I use **Wrapper** as the class name for every parent *div*, It helped me avoid namespace collision.

Importance of `.env` file, when I was searching the way of hiding API_KEY from the URL, I came across this "concept".
